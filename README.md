# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to collect data in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, perform an analysis (using analysis_run.R script), and output a tidy data set called averages_data.txt.

Steps to perform prior to running the R script, analysis_run.R:
1. Download project data from URL below:
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Uncompress the folder.
3. Move ALL files to your working directory individually (ie out of their respective folders):

Once completed, the analysis can be performed by sourcing analysis_run.R in R or R studio. Note that it requires the reshape2 package, which can be downloaded from CRAN.

The output of the R script is a tidy data set, averages_data.txt.

More information about the data can be found in CodeBook.md.
